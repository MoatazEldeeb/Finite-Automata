# NFA to DFA and CFG to PDA Converter
This is a Python project that provides functionality to convert non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) to deterministic finite automata (DFA) and context-free grammar (CFG) to pushdown automata (PDA).

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

## NFA to DFA Conversion
To convert an NFA to a DFA, run the following command:
```console
python configNFA.py
```
## CFG to PDA Conversion
To convert a CFG to a PDA, run the following command:
```console
python configCFG.py
```
